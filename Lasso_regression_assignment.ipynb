    "Ans:Lasso Regression, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a type of linear regression that uses L1 regularization to impose a penalty on the absolute size of the coefficients. It is similar to Ridge Regression, but instead of adding a penalty term to the sum of squared coefficients, it adds a penalty term to the sum of absolute coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main differences between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques, such as Ridge Regression or Ordinary Least Squares, is that it can be used for feature selection. The L1 penalty used in Lasso Regression encourages sparse solutions, which means that it tends to set some of the coefficients to zero. This has the effect of automatically selecting the most important features and eliminating the less important ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques is that it can handle multicollinearity by selecting one of the correlated variables and setting the others to zero. This can be useful in cases where there are many correlated predictors in the dataset"

    "Ans: The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is that it performs automatic feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively removing them from the model. This is because Lasso Regression uses L1 regularization, which adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. As a result, the coefficients of less important features are shrunk to zero, while the coefficients of important features remain non-zero. This makes Lasso Regression a useful technique for reducing the number of features in a model and improving its interpretability."

    "Ans: In Lasso Regression, the coefficients of the independent variables are shrunk towards zero. The magnitude of the coefficients indicates the strength of the association between each independent variable and the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lasso Regression, some coefficients can be exactly zero, which means that the corresponding independent variables have no impact on the dependent variable. This makes it easy to perform feature selection, as the independent variables with non-zero coefficients can be considered important predictors, while those with zero coefficients can be discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sign of the coefficients (positive or negative) indicates the direction of the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable. For example, a positive coefficient for an independent variable means that as the value of that variable increases, the value of the dependent variable also tends to increase, all other things being equal. A negative coefficient indicates that as the value of the independent variable increases, the value of the dependent variable tends to decrease."

    "Ans: In Lasso Regression, the tuning parameter is called alpha (α), which controls the degree of regularization applied to the model. When α is set to zero, Lasso Regression becomes the same as ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. As α increases, the model's complexity is reduced, and the coefficients are shrunk towards zero, which helps to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another parameter that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression is the maximum number of iterations, which controls the number of times the algorithm iteratively updates the coefficients before stopping. Increasing the number of iterations can improve the model's accuracy, but it can also increase the computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of alpha is critical in Lasso Regression, as it affects the sparsity of the model, i.e., the number of non-zero coefficients. A low value of alpha will result in a dense model with many non-zero coefficients, while a high value of alpha will result in a sparse model with fewer non-zero coefficients. The best value of alpha can be determined by cross-validation or other model selection techniques"

    "Ans: Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression are both linear regression techniques that aim to address the issue of overfitting. However, there are some key differences between the two:\n",

    "3.Handling multicollinearity: Ridge Regression is better suited for dealing with multicollinearity, while Lasso Regression may have issues if there are highly correlated variables in the dataset.\n",

    "S4.election of predictors: Ridge Regression retains all predictors in the model, while Lasso Regression can be used for feature selection and may result in a model with fewer predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Interpretation: The coefficients in Ridge Regression are typically more difficult to interpret than those in Lasso Regression, as they are not necessarily zero even if a predictor is not contributing much to the model. In Lasso Regression, coefficients that are exactly zero correspond to predictors that are not included in the model."
