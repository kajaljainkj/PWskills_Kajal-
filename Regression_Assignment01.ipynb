    "Ans:- Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. To obtain accurate results from a linear regression analysis, it is important that the following assumptions are satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable is linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Independence: The observations are independent of each other.\n",

    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, the following methods can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Linearity: A scatter plot of the dependent variable against each independent variable can be used to visually assess linearity. If the data points are scattered randomly around a straight line, then the linearity assumption is satisfied. If the scatter plot shows a curved or nonlinear pattern, then the linearity assumption is violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Independence: Independence can be checked by ensuring that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals. Autocorrelation occurs when the residuals at one point in time are correlated with the residuals at a previous or future point in time. This can be checked using a correlogram or the Durbin-Watson test.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Homoscedasticity: Homoscedasticity can be checked by plotting the residuals against the predicted values or the independent variables. If the plot shows a random scatter of points around the horizontal line, then the homoscedasticity assumption is satisfied. If the plot shows a funnel shape, then the homoscedasticity assumption is violated.\n",

    "4.Normality: Normality can be checked by plotting a histogram of the residuals or by using a normal probability plot. If the histogram or normal probability plot shows a bell-shaped curve, then the normality assumption is satisfied. If the plot shows a skewed distribution, then the normality assumption is violated.\n",

    "Ans:- In a linear regression model, the slope and intercept are the parameters that define the line that best fits the data. The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for a unit increase in the independent variable, while the intercept represents the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is equal to zero.\n",

    "Monthly sales revenue = Intercept + Slope * Advertising budget\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope represents the change in monthly sales revenue for a unit increase in the advertising budget. If the slope is positive, it means that an increase in the advertising budget leads to an increase in sales revenue, and vice versa. The magnitude of the slope represents the strength of the relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intercept represents the monthly sales revenue when the advertising budget is zero. This may not have a practical interpretation in the real world since it is unlikely that a company would have zero advertising budget. However, the intercept can still be useful in predicting the expected value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is at a low level.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the slope of the model is 0.5 and the intercept is Rs.10,000, it means that for every Rs.1,000 increase in the advertising budget, the monthly sales revenue is expected to increase by Rs.500. If the advertising budget is zero, the model predicts that the monthly sales revenue would be Rs.10,000."

    "Ans:- Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function by iteratively adjusting the parameters of the function in the direction of steepest descent, i.e., the direction of the negative gradient. The algorithm starts with an initial guess for the parameters and iteratively updates them until the minimum is reached or a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, gradient descent is used to minimize the loss function of a model by adjusting its parameters. The loss function measures the difference between the predicted output of the model and the actual output for a given input. By minimizing the loss function, the model is able to make more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general steps of gradient descent are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize the parameters of the model randomly or with some predefined values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter.\n",

    "Update the parameters by moving them in the direction of the negative gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the minimum of the loss function is reached or a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different variants of gradient descent, such as batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent. Batch gradient descent calculates the gradient using all the data points in the training set, while stochastic gradient descent uses only one data point at a time. Mini-batch gradient descent uses a small subset of the data points at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is a powerful algorithm used in machine learning to train models and optimize their parameters. It is used in a wide range of applications, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommender systems. However, it can be computationally expensive and may converge slowly if the learning rate is too high or too low. As such, there are other optimization algorithms, such as Adam and Adagrad, that can be used as alternatives to gradient descent."

A VIF greater than 5 or 10 is often considered a sign of multicollinearity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Captures nonlinear relationships: Polynomial regression can capture nonlinear relationships between the dependent and independent variables, whereas linear regression can only model linear relationships.\n",
    "Flexibility: The degree of the polynomial can be adjusted to fit the complexity of the relationship between the variables. This allows for greater flexibility in modeling the data.\n",

    "Complexity: As the degree of the polynomial increases, the model becomes more difficult to interpret and understand, as it involves higher-order terms and interactions between variables.\n",
    "In general, polynomial regression is preferred when there is evidence of a nonlinear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. This can be detected through visual inspection of the data, or by conducting statistical tests for nonlinearity. Additionally, polynomial regression may be preferred when there is a need for greater flexibility in modeling the data, such as when there are multiple peaks or curves in the relationship.\n",

    "However, it is important to be cautious when using polynomial regression, as higher-degree polynomials can easily overfit the data and reduce the generalizability of the model. Therefore, it is recommended to start with a lower-degree polynomial and gradually increase the complexity until the model fits the data well without overfitting. It is also important to validate the model using appropriate techniques such as cross-validation.\n",
